* finish X11 window control and event loop
* make GL output and state handling
* make GLSL program linking
* make seperate Vertex and Fragment shader "library" to mix and match
  and then send to the program linking
* GLSL shader handling ( setting current program or revert to default )
* maybe remove ARB handling of GLSL ( gives a lot of dual programming )
* maybe a load shader on demand system
